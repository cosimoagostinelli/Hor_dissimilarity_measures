    Generates a hypergraph by overlapping multiple layers, each layer being a higher-order 
    Watts-Strogatz-like model for a specific hyper-edge size s. For example, the layer for
    s=3 is created as follow: generate a ring lattice of overlapping 3-hyperedges of the

    probability ps[s-2] and the first node is kept within the hyperedge, while the others

    Parameters:
